## ***Introduction***

### **Problem statement:**
- Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and heatwaves, pose significant threats to human life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. These events have been increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change, making their timely and accurate detection more critical than ever. Traditional methods for identifying extreme weather events often rely on manual analysis by meteorologists or heuristic-based algorithms. These methods are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also susceptible to human error and may lack the precision needed to handle the complex and dynamic nature of weather patterns.

- With the advent of modern data acquisition technologies, there is an abundance of high-resolution environmental data available from various sources such as satellite imagery, weather radars, ground-based sensors, and remote sensing devices. However, the sheer volume and complexity of this data present significant challenges for effective analysis and real-time processing. Existing machine learning models have shown promise in analyzing such data, but they often struggle with the variability and unpredictability inherent in extreme weather events, leading to suboptimal performance in detection and classification tasks.

- This research seeks to address these challenges by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically designed for the detection and classification of extreme weather events. The use of CNNs is motivated by their proven ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw data, making them particularly well-suited for image and pattern recognition tasks. By leveraging custom-designed convolutional filters, this research aims to enhance the model's ability to capture critical features indicative of extreme weather conditions.

-The primary goal is to create a robust and efficient CNN-based system capable of processing large-scale environmental datasets in real-time, providing accurate and timely alerts for extreme weather events.
